By the time a child is six or seven she has all the essential 
avoidances well enough by heart to be trusted with the care of a 
younger child. And she also develops a number of simple 
techniques. She learns to weave firm square balls from palm 
leaves, to make pinwheels of palm leaves or frangipani blossoms, 
to climb a coconut tree by walking up the trunk on flexible little 
feet, to break open a coconut with one firm well-directed blow of 
a knife as long as she is tall, to play a number of group games 
and sing the songs which go with them, to tidy the house by 
picking up the litter on the stony floor, to bring water from the 
sea, to spread out the copra to dry and to help gather it in when 
rain threatens, to go to a neighboring house and bring back a 
lighted faggot for the chief's pipe or the cook-house fire.
